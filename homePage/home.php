<pre>My name is Alex Brasil. I am 26 years old and single, but dating. 
As my last name already says, I am from Brazil. My home town is called 
Parnaiba, located in the northeast region of the country. I come from a 
family of five people, my parents, my brother, my sister and I, which
I am the youngest one. I came to US four years ago. At first, I came to 
learn English, but now I've been in college for three years. My major is 
Software Engineering. I want to work with software develpment and maybe 
develop applications, I will see where my career will take me to. </pre>
